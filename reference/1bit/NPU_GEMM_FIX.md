# NPU GEMM execution fix — insts + BO group_ids (2026-08-31)

## The bug (proven on-device)

`run_gemm()` in `src/engine.cpp` called every xclbin kernel as

```cpp
(*kern)((uint64_t)3, (uint64_t)0, (uint32_t)0, act, ws, w1, w2, kv);
```

and every `xrt::bo` was created with `group_id = 0`. On the amdxdna driver
this combination is a **silent no-op**: the ERT command reports
`ERT_CMD_STATE_COMPLETED` but the AIE never executes and no buffer is touched
(verified with sentinel buffers on `Qwen3-0.6B-NPU2/mm.xclbin` — 0 bytes
changed across all 5 BOs). The "0 for pre-compiled" assumption in
`common.h` was wrong: these FastFlowLM xclbins carry no embedded control code.

Two separate faults:

1. **Missing instruction stream.** The amdxdna kernel ABI is
   `(opcode, instr_bo, ninstr, bo0..boN)`. Without `instr_bo` the command
   completes but nothing runs. The insts must be generated per GEMM shape
   (M/K/N/weight_offset) — see `tools/gen_mm_insts.cpp`, which drives
   FastFlowLM's own `Gemm::generate_seq` (linked against the prebuilt
   `libgemm.so`/`libqwen3_npu.so`).
2. **Wrong BO group ids.** amdxdna binds each host BO to its kernel argument
   slot via the BO group: opcode=0, instr=1, ninstr=2, host buffers from slot
   3 on. `kernel.group_id(3+i)` is what each buffer must be created with.
   group-0 BOs are ignored by kernels declaring non-zero groups, and large
   group-0 BOs can wedge the NPU (IO_PAGE_FAULTs) — the same root cause that
   made IRON's GEMM appear shape-broken earlier in this session.

## The fix (applied)

- `XclbinManager` now loads the companion `<xclbin>.bin` instruction stream at
  `load()` time, creates the insts BO with `kernel.group_id(1)`, and exposes
  `insts_bo(type)` / `ninstr(type)`.
- `run_gemm` / `run_blocked_gemm` pass `(3, insts, ninstr, ...)`.
- `NpuBo::create` takes a `group_id`; activation/workspace/kv/weight BOs are
  created with `kernel.group_id(3/4/5/7)` from the mm kernel.
- `XCLBIN_PATHS` points at the local FastFlowLM xclbin set
  (`/home/bcloud/amd-oss/fastflowlm/src/xclbins/Qwen3-0.6B-NPU2/`); the
  `/opt/fastflowlm` install path did not exist on this machine.
- `tests/test_npu_gemm.cpp` patched to the same pattern.
- New tool `tools/gen_mm_insts.cpp` + generated `mm.bin` next to `mm.xclbin`.

## Verified on silicon

With insts + kernel group ids, the same `mm.xclbin` kernel now executes:
- deterministic bulk output (byte-identical across runs except a 64-byte
  region at act[64..128), a design artifact),
- input-sensitive (changing A/B changes the output),
- offset-sensitive (generating insts with `weight_offset=1024` changes the
  result — the insts genuinely drive the DMA/compute).

## Round-27 (2026-08-31→09-01): the Q4NX weight format — dequant fixed & verified

The "still open" items below were attacked and largely resolved:

1. **The Q4NX dequant is now correct and BIT-EXACT vs the runtime.** Three
   bugs fixed in `model.c`/`model.h`/`engine.cpp`:
   - `model_tensor_data` did not add the JSON header (`8 + json_len`) to
     `desc->data_offset` — every tensor was read 34.6 KB early. Added
     `ModelWeights.data_base`, set in `model_load`, used in
     `model_tensor_data`.
   - `npu_dequant_block` read the 5120-byte "I8" rows as raw BF16 pairs. They
     are Q4NX tiles: [512 B bf16 scales][512 B bf16 zeros][4096 B packed
     int4]. Rewrote as a tile dequant (32x256 tile grid, g-major scale index
     `g*32+lr`, lane-swizzled nibbles).
   - The formula. The torch2aie/zaya convention `W = q*scale + zp` does NOT
     match the FastFlowLM Qwen3-0.6B file. Reverse-engineered against
     `libq4_npu_eXpress.so`'s own `q4nx_dequantize` (fed real + synthetic
     tiles): **W = (q − zp) · scale**, bf16 scales/zeros at group-major index
     `g*32+lr`, unsigned nibbles, NO clamping. Verified maxdiff 0.0 over the
     whole q_proj; the only residual vs the runtime is one BF16 ULP from
     storing the weight BO in BF16. `npu_weight_num_blocks` now returns the
     real block count (8 for q_proj, was 3).
2. **The mm.xclbin kernel consumes the REORDERED q/scale/zp layout** (the
   closed `_q4nx_reorder`), not raw tiles (output NaNs) and not dequantized
   BF16 (output zeros). Attacked via winboat/wine (2026-09-01): a mingw
   cross-compiled Windows dumper (`tools/winboat/dump_reorder_win.exe`) loads
   `q4_npu_eXpress.dll` and calls the buffer-split `q4nx_dequantize` — it runs
   under wine 10.0, the call succeeds, but the DLL's internal buffer resize
   discards the written payload on every path (owned/external/interposed).
   `reorder_cpy` (libqwen3_npu.so) is exported but its HRX dependency chain
   is not present in any accessible lib tree. The reorder layout therefore
   remains closed; the fixed-point validation stands on the engine's own
   kernels (GU→SiLU→D cascade, `bad=0/8192` silicon-exact) and the 1BP host
   contract gate (`test_1bp_q4nx_reader` PASSED).
3. **Per-shape insts**: still open (unchanged).
4. **×0.5 runner quirk**: still open (unchanged).

## Round-37 (2026-09-01): engine CORRECT — prefill logits match the real runtime (corr 1.0)

The runtime_layers path now produces **byte-identical logits to the real
FastFlowLM runtime** on the XDNA2 NPU.

### Fixes this round (engine was dead → correct)

1. **Use-after-move crash** in XclbinManager::load (local `kernel` unique_ptr
   moved into `e.kernel`, then dereferenced — segfault at group_id). Engine
   was dead on arrival.
2. **Down-projection OOB DMA** — [256,1024] blocks vs the K=3072 insts read
   2048 columns past the 1 MB BO (intermittent aie2_set_cmd_timeout). Fix:
   full-width [256, in_features] blocks for wide weights.
3. **Kernel-keyed insts** — the attn kernel executed the MM stream (shared
   cache key) → hang at layer 1. Fix: per-kernel insts keys/files.
4. **lm_head enabled** — kernel (elf_0002_lmhead.bin) + weight BO
   (pack_lmhead_bo, G=8) were DISABLED for the isolation test.
5. **Per-context layer ELFs to ctx 1024** — the decode died at ctx 7 (only
   6 ELFs captured); gen_layer_elfs generates any range.

### Verification

Token-1000 input (matching run_qwen3_npu):
- prefill logits corr **1.000000** vs the runtime's logits_1000.bin
- argmax 397 == 397, top5 identical [397, 3219, 144370, 42044, 255]
- decode ~15 ms/tok, 16 tokens generated

Tooling: NPU_LOGITS_DUMP (dump prefill logits), NPU_PROMPT_TOKEN (match
the harness input), gen_layer_elfs.sh (regenerate ELFs).

### Remaining

- The mm-split path (per-shape mm insts) is a secondary fallback; the
  fused runtime_layers path is the correct FastFlowLM design.
- The BOS-only "gibberish" was the model's unconditional 1-token
  generation — not an engine error. Real prompts should generate
  coherent text (tokenizer + chat template wiring is the next step).
npu-infer: KV byte-diff final — token-1 K/V computation differs from the runtime

Clean per-forward captures (RT_CLEAN_DUMP) + the runtime's completed kv
(kvpost_004) settle it:

- token-0 KV: BYTE-IDENTICAL (all 4 regions corr 1.0) AND the token-0 final
  hidden matches the runtime's actpost exactly (corr 1.0) — the ctx-1
  execution is fully exact.
- token-1 KV: the engine's values are NOT a permutation or a scale of the
  runtime's (aligned ratios vary: 0.21/-0.99/-34/2.26...; head-shift corr
  0.11; not the token-0 V). Same magnitude (std 11.6 vs 9.5) but entirely
  different values — the ctx-2 kernel computes the token-1 K/V
  differently than the runtime. The K (corr 0.81) is closer than the V
  (corr 0.02), suggesting the rope/rotation path is partially right but
  the projection write is not.
- The ctx-2 ELF is verified byte-exact (docs), the embeds byte-identical,
  the token-0 KV exact — so the defect is the ENGINE's ctx-2 execution of
  the token-1 K/V write (the layer kernel's 2-token projection path).

Status: the npu-infer engine is verified EXACT for single-token prefill
(logits corr 1.0, hidden corr 1.0, KV byte-identical). The multi-token
(token>=2) KV write is the precisely-identified remaining defect. All
capture/diff tooling committed (RT_CLEAN_DUMP, interposer kv captures,
gen_layer_elfs raw TXN). Next: audit the ctx-2 kernel's token-1 write
descriptors (the layer ELF's 2-token BD/offsets vs the engine's BO
binding) — the last step to full multi-token correctness.
npu-infer: KV rope test — token-1 K partial (0.81) vs V mismatched (0.02)

Rope-hypothesis test (engine token-1 vs runtime captures):
- engine token-1 K vs runtime token-1 K (pos 1): corr 0.81 — the K is
  PARTIALLY right (not the un-roped version: corr 0.03 vs pos-0).
- engine token-1 V vs runtime token-1 V: corr 0.02-0.11 — the V does not
  match (and not the token-1001-as-pos0 V either: corr -0.03).
- The engine's token-1 K/V differ from the runtime's in VALUE but match
  in MAGNITUDE (stds 2.8-11.8 vs 3.1-9.5) — a computation-order/descriptor
  difference, not a scale bug.
- The runtime's kvpost capture timing remains a confounder (its own
  token-1001-as-first KV appears to match the engine's token-0, which
  cannot be right for different tokens — the capture is mid-state).

Definitive, capture-independent facts:
- engine token-0: logits corr 1.0, final hidden corr 1.0, KV byte-identical
- engine token-1: logits corr 0.988 (very close), KV values differ

The remaining step is the ctx-2 layer kernel's token-1 write-descriptor
audit (the layer ELF's 2-token BD/offsets vs the engine's BO binding) —
a FastFlowLM-internals analysis that the capture toolchain (RT_CLEAN_DUMP
+ interposer kvpost) is now fully equipped to verify.

## 35B MoE (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NPU2) — path assessment (Round 37)

- The Unsupported intermediate size: 512 blocker was a HARNESS bug: the
  capture harness instantiated qwen3_npu (dense) for the MoE config. The
  qwen3_npu::Impl validates config.intermediate_size against
  {3072, 6144, 9728, 12288}; the qwen3_6_moe_npu class has no such check.
- The runtime's own qwen3_6_moe_npu::load_weights SEGFAULTS (upstream binary
  bug — qwen3_6_reorder_cpy BF16-vector reorder overflows its memcpy length,
  -169867392; gdb evidence in docs/35b-moe-load-crash.md). The runtime
  cannot serve as the 35B verification reference until ROCm ships a fixed .so.
- Engine parse fixes committed: tensor cap 512->2048, model.layer (singular)
  naming, derive num_layers/vocab/hidden from metadata (35B now reports
  673 tensors / 40 layers / vocab 248320 / hidden 2048), per-model xclbin
  selection (FLM_XCLBIN_PATH/xclbins/<model-name>, dequant_mm fallback).
- 35B layer-ELF path: libqwen3_6_moe_npu.so exports the layer-sequence
  primitives (generate_gate_delta_net_prefill_sequence, gen_mha_main,
  gen_mha_engine_seq) but the MoE-FFN sequence builder (router -> top-8
  experts -> up/down/gate dequant_mm gemms + shared expert) is internal to
  the binary Impl. Building it from npu_sequence primitives is the
  remaining engine feature (multi-day).
